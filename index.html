            <p>The Portland Hacker Foundation is a 501(c)(3) with a goal to take donations from the community and issue the funds as grants to people or organizations in the community who are building great things, with a strong focus on information security and related fields, especially those aligned with a strong hacker ethos. Grants will specifically target asymmetric impact, where small amounts of money ($1k, $5k, $10k, etc.) will enable significant work in the space. For this reason, early on, the most likely targets will be University research projects.</p>

            <p>As it stands, the current idea is that we would collect tax-deductible donations from the general public and organizations in our community, which will immediately be stored in a treasury consisting of low-risk index funds managed by Vanguard or similar. Maybe strategically across VITAX, VTSAX, VTIVX, etc.</p>

            <p>Every year, maybe January 1st, the size of the treasury will be observed, and expenses for the year will be calculated. Up to 5% of the treasury will go towards grants, up to 2% on events, and up to 2% on employee salary. Events and salary budget will likely not be accessed in the first few years of operation until the treasury grows to a sustainable size. Long term, if there are any full-time employees that need to be hired, their salaries will be capped at $100k, possibly pegged to 2025 inflation. The idea is to grow the treasury every year to enable more grants to the community as the treasury continues to grow.</p>

            <p>At PDXHF we strongly value diversity and inclusion to ensure maximum funding impact. We also support human rights for all humans, education, localism, artistic creativity, and the general Portlandian weirdness that keeps Portland a safe space for the type of creative work we need to build and grow as a leader in the global community.</p>
