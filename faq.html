              <h3>What is the Portland Hacker Foundation?</h3>
              <p>The Portland Hacker Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a mission to provide grants to people or organizations in the community who are building great things, with a strong focus on information security and related fields.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>How do you decide who gets grants?</h3>
              <p>Grant decisions are made through a voting process. We have an annual voting ceremony where our community and sponsors can vote on which projects to fund. Projects are evaluated based on their potential for asymmetric impact, meaning small amounts of money can enable significant work.</p>
